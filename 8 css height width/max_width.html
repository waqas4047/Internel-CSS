<!-- Setting max-width
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) 
of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no 
maximum width).

The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the 
    width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to
     the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of 
small windows.

Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference
 between the two divs! -->
