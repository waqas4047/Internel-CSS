Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

1 Serif    fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2 Sans-serif   fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3 Monospace    fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
4 Cursive      fonts imitate human handwriting.
5 Fantasy      fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
