             Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

       The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease -       specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear -     specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in -      specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out -         specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out -        specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
